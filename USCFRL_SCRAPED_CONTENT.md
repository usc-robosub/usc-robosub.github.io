Back then, the goal was simple: to design and build autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that could navigate and explore the mysteries of the deep. Armed with determination, innovative ideas, and limited resources, the team worked tirelessly in dorm rooms and basements, assembling their first prototypes from scratch.Each challenge they faced — from fine-tuning navigation algorithms to optimizing hydrodynamic designs — fueled their determination to push boundaries. Over the years, USC AUV has evolved into an organization that continuously tests what’s possible in underwater automation.Now, two decades later, the spirit of innovation remains at the core of everything we do. This legacy of passion and progress has culminated in our latest triumph: the 2025 Barracuda AUV.
